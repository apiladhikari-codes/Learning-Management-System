## Basic Folder Setup

Any folder that has `page.tsx` is considered to be a route.
What if we want a folder to be used as <i>structuring our code </i>? -> use route groups as (routeGroupName) ie. using parenthesis and giving a name which will not be translated as route
eg:`(testRouteGroup)`

## Authentication using <b>Clerk</b>

[Clerk Website documentation](https://clerk.com/docs)

I used clerk becuase it gives latest security features. We can set some public pages to be accessed without logging in app.
